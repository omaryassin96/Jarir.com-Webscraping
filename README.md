# About
Jarir is a Saudi store for selling computers and office supplies.

The team (Omar & Hagar) is going to **scrape** their website and make a smart website to work as a **Saudi laptops' buying guide** based on the products' data in their website.

# Detailed Idea
- Create a code to scrape Jarir laptops from [their website](https://www.jarir.com/sa-en/computers-&-tablets/laptops.html).

      70% Done - Facing a problem in pressing JS "Load more" buttons.
- Clean data.

      05% Done - The values of each column should be categorized to standard words to prepare for the choosing algorithm.
- Create an algorithm for filtering the laptops depending on questions asked to a customer.

      10% Done - Some question were collected from random people and from [our main compititor](https://www.choosist.com/us/laptops/start).
- Create a website for this algorithm.

      00% Done - Will begin with Hagar as soon as the algorithm is ready.

# Future Expansion
- Expand the scraping code to include all Saudi online stores.
- Improve the algorithm more (more inputs; such as processors details from intel website  + more smart choices).
- Improve website appearance and interactivity.

Bye
