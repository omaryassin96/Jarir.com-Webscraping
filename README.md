# About:
Jarir is a Saudi store for selling computers and office supplies.

The team (Omar & Hagar) is going to **scrape** their website and make a smart website to work as a **Saudi laptops' buying guide** based on the products' data in their website.

# Detailed Idea:
- **Scraping from [Jarir's website](https://www.jarir.com/sa-en/computers-&-tablets/laptops.html):**

      70% Done - Facing a problem in pressing the js "Load more" button.
- **Cleaning the Data:**

      05% Done - The values of each column should be categorized to standard words to prepare for the choosing algorithm.
- **Creating an Adaptive Laptop Choosing Algorithm:**

      10% Done - Some question were collected from random people and from our main compititor: choosist.com.
- **Createing a Website:**

      00% Done - Will begin with Hagar as soon as the algorithm is ready.

# Future Expansions:
- Expand the scraping code to include all Saudi online stores.
- Improve the algorithm more (more inputs; such as processors details from intel website  + more smart choices).
- Improve website appearance and interactivity.

Bye
